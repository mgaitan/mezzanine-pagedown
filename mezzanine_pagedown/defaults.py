"""
Default settings for the ``mezzanine_pagedown`` app.

Each of these can be overridden in your project's settings module, 
just like regular Django settings. 
The ``editable`` argument for each controls whether 
the setting is editable via Django's admin.
Thought should be given to how a setting is actually used before
making it editable, as it may be inappropriate - for example settings
that are only read during startup shouldn't be editable, since changing
them would require an application reload.
